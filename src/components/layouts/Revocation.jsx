        <span className="Para">
          One of the most common questions is how to revoke them. The problem is
          that once they are issued, no further communication is needed with the
          identity server.
        </span>

        <p className="Para">
          The fact that JWTs are only stored client-side leads to a fundamental
          disadvantage with JWTs. And that is: how do you revoke a userâ€™s
          access?
        </p>

        <p className="Para">
          Sure, JWTs have an expiry time and this can be as short-lived as you
          like. As soon as the access token expires however, the JWT is invalid
          and the client must re-authenticate with your server. This, of course,
          has a negative effect on the user experience.
        </p>

        <p className="Para">
          But suppose the user intentionally logs out of your system? Or you
          want to kick them out because you fear that security has been
          compromised? You cant: if they still have an unexpired token, they
          still have access.

          is a list of tokens that should no longer grant access to your system.
          Where you maintain this list is up to you.

        <p className="Para">
          You could use a traditional database, but a much better approach is to
          use an in-memory data cache, like Redis. An in-memory data cache
          provides much faster and more predictable seek times than data stored
          on disk.

        <span className="Para">
          This ensures data integrity and robust user authentication. Whenever
          developers use HMAC signatures, they need to provide a secret key,
          which is used for both signing and verifying tokens. If this secret is
          not strong enough, the whole signature can be compromised.
